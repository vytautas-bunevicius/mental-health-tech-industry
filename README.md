## Overview

This project involves the analysis of survey data related to mental health in the tech industry. The dataset includes responses from tech professionals, covering a range of topics such as attitudes toward mental health, reported mental health disorders, and the availability of resources in the workplace. The analysis aims to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that contribute to a better understanding of mental health issues within the tech sector.

## Research Objectives

1. **Structure Analysis:** Understand the structure of survey questions to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
2. **Attitudes Exploration:** Explore tech workers' attitudes toward mental health, identifying trends and influencing factors.
3. **Disorder Frequency:** Investigate the occurrence and distribution of reported mental health disorders among tech professionals.
4. **Resource Correlation:** Assess the correlation between mental health resource availability and reported mental health disorders.
5. **Survey Comprehensiveness:** Evaluate the overall comprehensiveness of the survey in addressing mental health issues in the tech industry.

## Hypotheses

1. **H1:** Mental health issues among tech professionals have increased over the years.
2. **H2:** Demographic factors such as age and gender influence the existence of mental health issues.
3. **H3:** There is a correlation between the availability of mental health resources and reported mental health issues.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Questions

1. What is the distribution of reported mental health disorders among tech professionals?
2. How have attitudes towards mental health evolved over surveyed years?
3. Are there differences in the reported incidence of mental health issues based on demographic factors?
4. What topics related to mental health are covered in the survey, and how has this evolved over time?
5. How aware are tech professionals of mental health resources in their workplace?

## Findings and Insights

### 1. Attitudes Toward Mental Health
- The discussion of "mental health" and related terms surged in 2017 and 2018, peaking at 38%, indicating growing relevance.
- The trend reversed in 2019 to 34.65%, suggesting a declining interest.
- Despite the peak in 2018, the average age of affected individuals remained stable at 35, indicating potential resilience and improved awareness.

### 2. Gender and Participation
- The percentage of female respondents increased alongside the rise in mental health discussions, reaching 30% in 2018.
- Female participation declined by 2.2% in 2019, suggesting a potential correlation between keyword usage and female participation.

### 3. Company Size and Discussions
- Smaller companies engaged more in mental health discussions during peak periods, possibly due to higher workloads.
- Larger companies, despite fewer participants, discussed mental health less, raising questions about resource availability.

### 4. Resource Availability
- The analysis shows that larger companies (1000+ employees) corresponded with a higher availability of mental health resources.
- However, the correlation between reported mental health disorders and resource availability is very close to zero, it suggests that there is not a significant linear relationship between the number of reported mental health disorders and the availability of mental health resources

## Future Improvements

1. **Diversity and Inclusion:** Expand demographic questions to capture a broader range of identities, enhancing diversity insights.
2. **Geographical Specifics:** Incorporate more detailed location-related questions for a granular analysis of mental health trends.
3. **Remote Work Impact:** Refine questions related to remote work conditions to understand the unique challenges faced by remote workers.
4. **Qualitative Insights:** Integrate open-ended qualitative questions for richer, in-depth insights into participants' experiences.
